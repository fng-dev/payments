## Configs

### ENV

laravel / lumen

MERCADO PAGO ENVIROMENT

The return url for the webhook, as well as the response url, use the laravel/lumen ```APP_URL``` variable to build the final url. Don't forget to add it to the Mercado Pago panel.

```
APP_URL=https://api.your-site.com
```

If you need to take any action after a ```Mercado Pago Webhook``` or ```Transbank Response``` request, such as sending an email for example, you can enter an internal endpoint to be called at the end of the ```MERCADO PAGO``` or ```TRANSBANK``` request. Keep in mind that the first request from the ```Mercado Pago Webhook``` waits 22 seconds for a valid response, and the next only 5 seconds.

inform variable ```MERCADO_PAGO_INTERNAL_WEBHOOK``` in your .env file with the endpoint

inform variable ```TRANSBANK_INTERNAL_WEBHOOK``` in your .env file with the endpoint

This hook is made in POST format, and sends a ```JSON``` object as a parameter

[POST] Create

After configuring everything, you can initiate a payment by accessing the following routes via post.

```[POST] /payments/mercadopago/create```

```[POST] /payments/webpay/create```

These routes wait as parameters the following data:

```json
{
    "items": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "Item 1",
            "quantity": 1,
            "price_unit": 200000, // without dots - just numbers
            "img_url": "https://path/to/img", // Optional
            "description": "description", // Optional
            "unit": "ml", // Optional
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "name": "Item 2",
            "quantity": 3,
            "price_unit": 50000, // without dots - just numbers
            "img_url": "https://path/to/img", // Optional
            "description": "description", // Optional
            "unit": "ml", // Optional
        }
    ],
    "payer": {
        "name": "Franco",
        "surname": "Nascimento"
    },
    "amount": 350000, // Total with shipping
    "shipping_amount": 0 // Optional 
}
```

 If the field does not have an 'optional' flag, it is required.

 ```[POST] /payments/mercadopago/create```
 
 If everything went well, and the request was successful, the mercadopago method will return a url to go to the payment methods.

 ```json
{
    "url": "https://sandbox.mercadopago.cl/checkout/v1/redirect?pref_id=567061042-a0d6bf78-c9db-4743-bb01-ee4fb31699"
}
```

 ```[POST] /payments/webpay/create```
 
 If everything went well, and the request was successful, the transbank method will return a url and a token, to go to the payment methods.

 In this case, the request must be made through a POST, sending the token as a parameter.

 ```json
{
    "token_ws": "e974070a11ba9d117d9f6f85d576d87fb1efb2cf05962b366cb355ab1fc116",
    "url": "https://webpay3gint.transbank.cl/webpayserver/initTransaction"
}
